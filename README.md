# Stand-structural-complexity-index---SSCI

The R-code computes the stand structural complexity index (SSCI) for terrestrial LiDAR based point clouds. Details on index construction and functionality
are introduced in Ehbrecht, M., Schall, P., Ammer, C., & Seidel, D. (2017). Quantifying stand structural complexity and its relationship with forest management, 
tree species diversity and microclimate. Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 242, 1-9.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.04.012.

SSCI is designed for point clouds based on single terrestrial laser scans. Efforts to make it functional for multiple-scan based point clouds and point clouds 
based mobile hand-held scanners are underway.
